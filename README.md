- 👋 Hello, Namaste, नमस्कारः, Hallo, Salam, I’m @anjani-dhrangadhariya
- I’m interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Semantics and FAIR standards in Life Sciences. I am trained in bioinformatics and am keen to employ my skills in this area. 
- Earlier, I was learning the use of weak supervision for information extraction for clinical and health-related entities and spans.
- Currently working on active learning methodologies applied to real-world scenarios.

- ♡♡♡ I love knowing about similarities in different languages, especially how Hindi and its mother, Sanskrit, are linked to Persian and its mother, Avestan, by the threads of history. Avestan and Sanskrit have several cognates and are mutually intelligible, forming deep links between ancient India and Iran far before the Arab conquest. Check out the repos @persian-hindi and @sanskrit-avestan ♡♡♡
